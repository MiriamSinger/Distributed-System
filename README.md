# Distributed-System

Java Distributed System that receives communication with a master program that sends 'jobs' to a client program that are fulfilled by slaves. Master may send varried jobs, which are each optimized for a specific slave, and are sent based on the optimal completion time for the job based on slave availability. Clients respond to the master when jobs are completed using sockets.
Project completed in collaboration with Tehila Raful, Carrie Gross, and Rina Mezei.
